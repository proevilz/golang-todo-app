# golang-todo-app

This was my first attempt at learning golang.
It is a simple todo CRUD API with a React frontend built with Vite and TypeScript.

## Running the API
 ```
 $ cd /go-api
 $ go run main.go
 ```

## Running the frontend
 ```
 $ cd /go-todo-fe
 $ yarn dev or npm run dev
 ```
 
 # Todo
 - Add database support
 - Write tests
